# **Phase A**
The main purpose of the first phase was to create a static website for our e-learning service. Specifically:

##  1. **Structure and Content**
 -  In this task we were asked to create at least seven HTML pages that cover core website areas such as a home page, thematic categories, pages for specific subcategories (each featuring lists of at least three books and three recorded lectures), a detailed page for a book (with table of contents, chapters, images, ratings, etc.), a similar page for a video lecture, and an “About Us” page with team member biographies. This had to be completed using semantic HTML elements, including proper metadata, and maintaining a consistent header/footer with navigation.

##  2. **Content Formatting**

- Next we had to style the pages we created using CSS. Some of the directions given to us included creating reusable CSS rules, using a range of combinatorial selectors and different levels of specialization in CSS rules, applying consistent background styles, text formatting (with proper font families and sizes), image sizing, and CSS pseudo-classes for link states.

##  3. **Layout**

-  Here we design a unified layout across pages using CSS Grid for overall structure ( for the most pages with at least 3 columns for desktop screen size) and Flexbox for organizing elements like navigation menus and content blocks.

##  4. **Responsive Design**

- Then we were asked to adapt the layout for various devices using media queries, flexible grids (using fr units, percentages, and minmax()), and responsive images.  
- Key point was to implement a mobile-friendly one-column layout, a two-column layout for tablets, and a three-column layout for desktops.

## 5. **HTML Form and Validation**
- Lastly we had to develop an additional registration page featuring a comprehensive HTML form.  The form should collect personal details (name, email, address, birth date, phone), login credentials (username and password with confirmation), communication preferences, and responses to at least five survey questions.  
-  We were directed to use appropriate HTML form elements (with fieldset, labels, and placeholders), style them with CSS for a modern look, and implement both built-in HTML validations and custom JavaScript validations (using the Constraint Validation API) for complex rules such as password matching and age restrictions.
