            This is the first textbook on pattern recognition to present the
            Bayesian viewpoint. The book presents approximate inference
            algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where
            exact answers are not feasible. It uses graphical models to describe
            probability distributions when no other books apply graphical models
            to machine learning. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or
            machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate
            calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience
            in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as
            the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability
            theory.

            This book offers a detailed and up-to-date introduction to machine
            learning (including deep learning) through the unifying lens of
            probabilistic modeling and Bayesian decision theory. The book covers
            mathematical background (including linear algebra and optimization),
            basic supervised learning (including linear and logistic regression
            and deep neural networks), as well as more advanced topics
            (including transfer learning and unsupervised learning).
            End-of-chapter exercises allow students to apply what they have
            learned, and an appendix covers notation.

            Machine learning methods are now an important tool for scientists,
            researchers, engineers and students in a wide range of areas. This
            book is written for people who want to adopt and use the main tools
            of machine learning, but aren’t necessarily going to want to be
            machine learning researchers. Intended for students in final year
            undergraduate or first year graduate computer science programs in
            machine learning, this textbook is a machine learning toolkit.
            Applied Machine Learning covers many topics for people who want to
            use machine learning processes to get things done, with a strong
            emphasis on using existing tools and packages, rather than writing
            one’s own code.

            The goal of this course is to give an introduction to the field of
            machine learning. The course will teach you basic skills to decide
            which learning algorithm to use for what problem, code up your own
            learning algorithm and evaluate and debug it. The field of machine
            learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer
            programs that automatically improve with experience. Recently, many
            successful machine learning applications have been developed,
            ranging from data-mining programs that learn to detect fraudulent
            credit card transactions, to information-filtering systems that
            learn users' reading preferences, to autonomous vehicles that learn
            to drive. There have also been important advances in the theory and
            algorithms that form the foundation of this field. This course will
            provide a broad introduction to the field of machine learning.

            Description: <br />
            This class offers a hands-on approach to machine learning and data
            science. The class discusses the application of machine learning
            methods like SVMs, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting and neural
            networks on real world dataset, including data preparation, model
            selection and evaluation. This class complements COMS W4721 in that
            it relies entirely on available open source implementations in
            scikit-learn and tensor flow for all implementations. Apart from
            applying models, we will also discuss software development tools and
            practices relevant to productionizing machine learning models.

            Description: <br />
            Complex data can be represented as a graph of relationships between
            objects. Such networks are a fundamental tool for modeling social,
            technological, and biological systems. This course focuses on the
            computational, algorithmic, and modeling challenges specific to the
            analysis of massive graphs. By means of studying the underlying
            graph structure and its features, students are introduced to machine
            learning techniques and data mining tools apt to reveal insights on
            a variety of networks.

            Description: <br />
            Led by Andrew Ng, this course provides a broad introduction to
            machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics
            include: supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning,
            parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector
            machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
            reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance
            tradeoffs, practical advice); reinforcement learning and adaptive
            control. The course will also discuss recent applications of machine
            learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous
            navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web
            data processing.
