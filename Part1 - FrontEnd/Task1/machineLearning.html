                This is the first textbook on pattern recognition to present the
                Bayesian viewpoint. The book presents approximate inference
                algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations
                where exact answers are not feasible. It uses graphical models
                to describe probability distributions when no other books apply
                graphical models to machine learning. No previous knowledge of
                pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed.
                Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra
                is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities
                would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a
                self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.

                This book offers a detailed and up-to-date introduction to
                machine learning (including deep learning) through the unifying
                lens of probabilistic modeling and Bayesian decision theory. The
                book covers mathematical background (including linear algebra
                and optimization), basic supervised learning (including linear
                and logistic regression and deep neural networks), as well as
                more advanced topics (including transfer learning and
                unsupervised learning). End-of-chapter exercises allow students
                to apply what they have learned, and an appendix covers
                notation.

                Machine learning methods are now an important tool for
                scientists, researchers, engineers and students in a wide range
                of areas. This book is written for people who want to adopt and
                use the main tools of machine learning, but aren’t necessarily
                going to want to be machine learning researchers. Intended for
                students in final year undergraduate or first year graduate
                computer science programs in machine learning, this textbook is
                a machine learning toolkit. Applied Machine Learning covers many
                topics for people who want to use machine learning processes to
                get things done, with a strong emphasis on using existing tools
                and packages, rather than writing one’s own code.

                From the author of a world bestseller published in eleven
                languages, The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book, this new book
                by Andriy Burkov is the most complete applied AI book out there.
                It is filled with best practices and design patterns of building
                reliable machine learning solutions that scale. Andriy Burkov
                has a Ph.D. in AI and is the leader of a machine learning team
                at Gartner. This book is based on Andriy's own 15 years of
                experience in solving problems with AI as well as on the
                published experience of the industry leaders.
