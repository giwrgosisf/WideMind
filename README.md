## **Description**
WideMind is a website that serves as a simplified version of an e-learning service in the field of Computer Science, based on textbooks and recorded lectures. This project was developed for the Web Development course of AUEB in 7th Semester and was divided into two phases.

## **Phase A**
The main purpose of the first phase was to create a static website for our e-learning service. This was done by completing five tasks, which progressively constructed our website. More details can be found [here.](https://github.com/giwrgosisf/WideMind/tree/main/Part1%20-%20FrontEnd) 

## **Phase B**
In this phase we are using dynamic functionality to make our website interactive. It integrates modern client-side frameworks such as Handlebars and React to render dynamic content and manage user interactions, including navigation and shopping cart features. On the backend, Node.js with Express powers the server, while the Fetch API enables smooth communication with the LearningHub API to retrieve educational materials in real time.
